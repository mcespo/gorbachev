import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Who is working on this?

Professionals.

## What is being done?

The counter-tops will be replaced by either a granite or quartz counter-top.

## When will this begin?

After the counter-tops are removed and the kitchen counters are readjusted and realigned. The island should also be in place.

## Where is this going?

Right on top of the base cabinets.

## Why not kee the cabinets?

I am not confident that I wont break them. I could try and hold onto them but I would need some sort of diamond cutter to make up for the new layout.

## How will the work be done?

<Steps>
  1. Find a counter-top vendor and get quotes around the size of the kitchen counters.
  2. ???
  3. Profit.
