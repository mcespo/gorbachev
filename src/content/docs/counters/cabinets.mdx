## Who is working on this?

Marvin.

## What is being done?

Most of the cabinets are going to remain in place. The cabinets that are being removed are the ones that are in the way of the new layout. The cabinets that are being removed are the ones that pivot out our existing peninsula shape.

## When will this begin?

Before the demo can begin.

## Where is this going?

Existing cabinets will be removed (safely) to account for the demolition. Top cabinets will be unscrewed and I may need a multi-tool near the drywall to ensure I don't accidentally rip out any adhered portions of the cabinets.

## Why not replace the cabinets overall?

The cabinets are in good shape and we are trying to keep the cost down. We are going to likely paint the cabinets or possibly leave them as is. We are still deciding on the final look.

## How will the work be done?

<Steps>
  1. Start by cutting the top area with a knife or maybe a multi-tool. Unscrew
  the cabinets and carefully remove them. The cabinets will be stored in the
  garage for now.
  2. For the counter-tops, using a multi-tool, try and peirce
  any screws that are holding the counter-tops in place. Once the screws are
  removed, the counter-tops should be able to be lifted off. PLEASE NOTE THIS
  WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK AND LIKELY BE HEAVY.
