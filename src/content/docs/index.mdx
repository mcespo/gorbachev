## Welcome!

It's your friendly neighborhood Marvin here. I'm excited to share this site as a living journal to a massive house renovation project my spouse and I are going to undertake.

What is the goal? To take down our living room wall and open up the kitchen to the rest of the house. This is going to be rather large and I am open to ideas, opinions and assistance. Consider this my mid-life crisis of sorts and a celebration of turning 40.

Feel free to hit u the about to get a feel for the "why", or click around to the various sections to better understand how we are looking to tackle any particular sections. This site is an active document, and much is subject to change the more data and quotes I acquire.

Without further ado, let's get started!
